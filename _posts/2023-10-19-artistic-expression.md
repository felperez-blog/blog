One of the fundamental struggles of self-expression through art is the constant pursuit of technique improvement. Centering on technique can make you lose focus on your main goals. I spent several years mindlessly practicing guitar technique but never making any progress on the self-expression front. I was never able to achieve a sound that I called my own. I knew countless words, but I didn’t know how to put them together into a coherent tale. Trying out new things made me realize that the exploration of technique should be in line with the expansion of your artistic vocabulary. You don’t want to learn words that you’re not able to integrate into your daily speech. One needs to let go of the expectations of greatness or perfection and start producing art with the tools you have available, as soon as possible.
