I have never talked about this openly, but the PhD was a really traumatic experience for me. I managed to do it but damn, that thing was brutal. A few factors contributed to the experience being traumatic like I said. In short, not having friends from the beginning, being from a different culture, still having big language barrier, the weather being very gray, being stuck with my problem for months on an end, among others. These factors made the first two years of the phd really hard emotionally for me, as I had to deal with feelings of inadequacy, loneliness, boredom, and even sadness. I never got a diagnose but I'd be surprised if I wasn't depressed back then. By the third year many things in my life improved, and I formed a family, which shifted the perspective from academia to my family. At some points I was very close to quitting the program. In retrospective I could have done many more fun things, but if I'm being honest, I was too depressed to even try new things. I think having a family was the only thing that gave me an impulse strong enough so that I would finish it. That's how hard it felt for me. I hope my fellows PhD's are not having such a hard time, but I have no doubts many of them are. The experience looks much nicer before you do it, but that can vary a lot person to person. Some people have it great, other not so great.
