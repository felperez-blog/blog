Both my PhD and covid created a special circumstance in my life that allowed me to establish a very special bond with my daughter, as I spent the first two years of her life working from home. We spent a lot of time together, and have become really close up until this day when she is 4. This strong bond is what makes what I'm going through today specially hard. Today I am forced to go back to Chile, against my will, against my desire to stay with my family. I am not being dragged out of the country, but it is basically that. If I stayed for longer, I would receive severe punishment and possibly a ban against living here. The system is incredibly unfair, incredibly racist, incredibly inhumane, incredibly dishonest. They say they want only the good ones, but according to that logic I should check all the boxes. I have high education, I am married to a US citizen, I have a US daughter, I am from a reasonably stable country, what else do they want from me? With all of this we're going into 18 months now? I don't know, I lost track of the count. This system has no compassion for the humans that suffer from it, and oh boy, I am not even in the worst end of the spectrum. Immigrants are humans too. I'm not asking for a free pass to live in the US, but for a process that treats people with dignity. A process that doesn't make people wait unknown amounts of time in the dark, separate from their family, without any certainty of when they will be able to be together. A process that's clear and not designed to make you make errors in every single step. It's so bad that there's an entire industry that parasites from the complexity of the immigration process, which as usual, creates socioeconomic disparities. Because if you have money, let's pay an immigration lawyer to handle everything with the expertise of a whole company. But if you're a regular person, gotta figure it out all by yourself.
