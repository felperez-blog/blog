If you lived during the late 90s and early 2000s, it is very likely that at least you saw a Tamagotchi.
In case you don't know what a Tamagotchi is, allow me to introduce you to it:

As you can see, it is a digital device in the shape of an egg, with a small screen and three round buttons.
Its name is a portmanteau of two Japanese words: tamago, which means egg, and uotchi, which means watch.
When you first start the device, the tiny screen will display an egg, which after a few minutes, will
hatch a creature, which we will also refer to as the Tamagotchi. The idea of this toy is that you have
to take care of it as if it was a real pet, although of a much simpler nature. Using combinations of the
three buttons, the owner of the Tamagotchi needs to keep it well fed, healthy, happy and disciplined, all
through a set of actions designed to fulfill each and every need of the Tamagotchi. This way, one can nurture
the creature and see it evolve/grow as the days go by. It is a simple toy and many of us 90s kids had one
at some point of our childhoods.

It is 2024, decades after the initial release of the toy, decades after I have even heard of it, but one
day, my brain decided it was a good time to remember it. I didn't make much of it, but now I had it in
my mind. When Christmas approached, the thought proved to be useful, as I suggested my wife: "what if we
get our daughter a Tamagotchi? She would probably like it". She remembered it from her childhood with fondness
as well, so we decided to go for it. We ordered it online and it came only a few days later. We wrapped it
and it patiently sat underneath the Christmas tree until the 25th.

When the day came, my five years old daughter was thrilled with excitement after seeing it for the first time. She saw
the egg appear for the first time on the screen, and together we waited until it hatched, bringing joy
to all as we saw the little blob with eyes show up in front of us. I taught her the basics of caring for the 
creature, which she promptly picked up. In no time, she was able to take full care of her new digital
companion. Resembling of a human child, the Tamagotchi would beep, when in need of attention, be it because
of hunger or because of boredom, and as a good caretaker, she quickly responded to fulfill its needs.
As the days went by, she became an expert on caring for the Tamagotchi, even making sure that after going
to sleep the device would sit comfortably on its bed (ie, its plastic packaging). This way, the creature
was nurtured enough to grow into a duck-like animal, which was later known as Duckie. Given the small size
of the device, she was able to carry it basically everywhere we went, which is the point of it.

As versed as I may seem on the nature of Tamagotchis, I am far from an expert, and one particular area
of weakness of my expertise, is the lifespan of these creatures. Only a few days after hatching the egg,
right before bedtime, we found ourselves puzzled when seeing the screen of the device show a sort of alien
spaceship with a creature inside. We had never seen this screen, and the buttons did not seem to have any
effect on it. Given that it was close to bedtime, I decided that the matter would have
to wait until tomorrow, so I would have time to search online what was the state of the Tamagotchi when
facing that screen, so she went to bed and I went to investigate the situation. My surprise was big when
the information on the Internet seemed to point out that the creature had reached the end of its
life cycle, and was now ready to depart to its planet (in previous versions of the device it would show a
much more grim tombstone instead of the spaceship, implying that the creature had actually died). This
was highly unexpected for me, as I imagined the lifespan of these creatures would be on the orders of 
several weeks at least. So I sat, trying to think how would I explain this to my daughter the next day.

I thought that I would have some time to come up with a reasonable explanation, but my time was cut short
when my daughter showed up to the living room, saying that she was worried about her Tamagotchi, that she
didn't know what it had happened to it. Me and my wife tried to put it in the nicest words we could,
explaining that she had taken really good care of the Tamagotchi, and that now it was ready to go to its
home planet. While she understood this, she was not ready for the departure of the creature she had taken
care of exclusively during the last few days. I was not ready. She had dedicated all of her attention and
love to Duckie, who all of a sudden, without any warning, had to leave for its planet. She had lost what was
essentially her first pet. We cried together, acknowledging how sad this had made us, and how much we 
would miss Duckie. We let our feelings out, and we decided to memorialize Duckie with art. The three of us
made renditions of the Tamagotchi to help remember how important it was in our life.

She also decided to write her last farewell to Duckie on a letter, which she read out loud for me to write down.

Through the process of making art, we were all able to go through the grief of losing someone we cared about,
and we were able to transition to an acceptance state, in which we felt like we were ready to make the next
step and hatch a new Tamagotchi egg, remembering how important Duckie was for us. We were also able to
immortalize the memory of Duckie, who was not even made of matter but only of energy, stored inside capacitors
and transistors. Duckie may not have been a physical being, but at the emotional level, that did not matter,
as its departure clearly showed us that we felt a deep connection to this simple digital being. Who would have
imagined that a simple Japanese toy would be a device to introduce deep life lessons such as loss and grief
to the life of our precious daughter? 

Goodbye Duckie.
