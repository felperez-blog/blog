We live in an era where interpersonal  communication and information acquisition happens through channels which are heavily optimized to create the highest possible engagement, with the ultimate motivation of increasing the profit of a handful of corporations. This means that there are mechanisms in place that operate beyond our understanding, that have the unique purpose of keeping us engaged in these channels. These mechanisms know nothing about our social fabric, and as such, they will tear it apart if that is what yields the highest profit for their owners. In practice this means that we will be constantly bombarded with inflammatory news and opinions that will trigger a need to go and take a side on the current conflict and defend it, getting as many likes as possible, as well as many comments against it. The consequences on our mental state and view towards others are unknown to me, but I do believe that it predisposes us to fight and increases our overall anxiety and stress levels. These small scale fights are what ultimately ends up becoming social action, enabling macro scale fights. We are living in troubled times, but this is nothing new to us as a species. We have developed the capacity to resolve conflict through pacific means, by employing both empathy and reason. This is the only way to true peace, conflict only serves the interests of people in power.
