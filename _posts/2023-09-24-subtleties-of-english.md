English is a language with an incredible number of subtleties in pronunciation, which I have yet to master. 
For native speakers, they may seem quite basic, but for us, many of those are just things that go way over our head. 
In English, for instance, consonants can be voiced or voiceless. Voiced is when you make your vocal cords vibrate, and voiceless
is when you don't. The example that we are commonly aware of is 'v' vs 'b'. In Spanish, we don't make a big distinction 
between them, so at first, catching the differences is hard. But it doesn't stop there. 
 
The 'z' sound does not exist in many Latin American versions of Spanish. It is a sound that still requires me a lot of effort to
make in regular speech. The fact that it just shows up in words that are not spelled with a 'z' makes it particularly challenging.
For instance, for me, “eyes” and “ice” were pronounced the same for the longest time, until I learned about eyes being pronounced
with the 'z' sound. Another example is the 'th' sound, which can be voiced, like in "that", and voiceless, like in “thing”. Something else that I only learned like this year is that the word “guacamole” is pronounced with a G plus a W, so it is like 'gwacamole'. 

This is all pertaining to the consonants, while the situation with the vowels is much more complicated. In Spanish, we have basically 5 different vowel sounds (very similar to the vowels in Japanese). In English, there are more than 10 vowel sounds, I believe close to 15. This chart gives a good summary of them:

The Spanish vowels can be approximately mapped to some of these sounds, but the remaining ones are very complex for us to articulate them correctly, as they correspond to essentially upgraded grunts or scoffs. 
That is why it is so easy to identify a Spanish speaker by the way they speak English, because of how all the sounds are mapped to English. All of these complexities pertain just to the realm of the sounds, because the writing is also highly complicated when it comes to the writing patterns and how they map to sounds. 
Going from functional to mastering it is maybe a longer road than from beginner to functional.
