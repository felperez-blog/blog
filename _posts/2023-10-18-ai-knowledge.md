I find it kind of incredible it is when it comes to those areas, like, it’s just a bunch of matrices. How can just a bunch of numbers basically fit a great amount of knowledge? It’s just incredible to me. I suppose that the architecture also holds a lot of information too, at a higher level. I think the architecture plus the relationships between the parameter also act as a compressing mechanism. You could most surely compress the information that is sent in a regular communication to a fairly small language. Idk it’s still crazy to me. The combinatorics of the space of parameters learned is absolutely enormous, but the useful ones are probably a very small manifold or structure like that that lives somewhere in this high dimensional space.

I know that it makes things up very often because it’s ultimately a language model, not a knowledge storing mechanism. Knowledge precision is not a metric that I believe is being optimized, it seems to be an emergent property product of the complexity of the models.
