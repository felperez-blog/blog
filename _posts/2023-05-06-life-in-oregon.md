Since I've moved to the US, I can say confidently now, I have been overall happier. Of course being with my family is a big thing, but if I compare the time we spent together in Chile vs the time we've spent here, I have personally, and also as as family, been much happier than before. The reasons are multiple and most of them are kind of grim. We just didn't have a very good time in Chile, a lot of bad things aligned at the same time, so it was bad luck in a big portion, but I want to focus in one of them. I've always been a person who loves nature. I've always been drawn to forests, mountains, rivers, and so many others (donkey Kong country gets a big part of the blame here), and while in Chile, it was kind of hard to tap into that part of me. Santiago was specially unforgiving in that sense, as it was very loud, chaotic, dirty, stressful, and it had not a lot of cool nature around. Going to cool places always felt like a big commitment. Here in the US, specially in Oregon, I feel very privileged to be able to grab the car, drive for 20 min and be in a forest, with very little human made noise, with giant trees around, open spaces for penny and my dog to run around, etc. Today we brought a little tent we have and we were able to relax for a minute. Those are things that bring me a tremendous amount of joy, and recharge me a lot. I understand that is sort of a privilege of living in the developed world, but I don't feel bad making use of it. I still have to make a few things happen here to really be able to call it my home (things such as making more local friends), but I have been feeling really good. It's something I appreciate a lot these days.
