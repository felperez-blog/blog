I don’t talk a lot about my daughter because, you know, it’s not my business to be sharing much about her life. But I just wanted to share one thing. As you may know, I'm a big fan of Pokémon. Well, so is she. We talk all the time about Pokémon, we play Pokémon games, we collect the Pokémon cards, etc. I started trying to draw, because I like drawing Pokémon and because I can give them to her afterward. We bond a lot over Pokémon, we spend a lot of quality time doing things around Pokémon. Not only that, but in practice it is an almost infinite well of topics to talk about with her. Pokémon changed my life twice: for me as a child and for me as the father of a child.
